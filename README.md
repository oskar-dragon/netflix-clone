# Netflix Clone

## üéØ General Information
I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App and implementing all I've learned so far about React.
I've tried to replicate the layout as much as I could taking into consideration my experience. This app takes the user to a homepage
where the user is welcomed with some information about Netflix. A user has an option to create an accout with an email and login.

Once user is logged in, a user lands on a hompage on which one can find two categories with movies and series, and all of them are
divided by categories into rows. Each row has movies/series thumbnails that can be clicked on and more information about this particular
movie or series will be shown. If user clicks on a play button, a pop-up will show up and user can play video. 

Please play with and and and if you have any feedbacks, feel free to get in touch with me. I would appreciate it a lot.
